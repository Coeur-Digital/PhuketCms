The combined use of Node.js and Express.js indeed makes it possible to rapidly develop entire websites. This framework is a real toolbox for developers who want to create a JavaScript website on both client and server side. By generating all the basic necessities at the start of an empty project and by providing all the directories and typical files to avoid the developer having to write them himself, the Express “generator” thus simplifies the creation of complex applications. For developers, the time savings is considerable. Express allows them to do everything that Node.js does, but by reducing the  number of lines of code. Express.js maps the URL in a template and populates the values ​​with data from a generic data store. This use of templates to create HTML greatly reduces the amount of input for the developer and thus speeds up agency work.","notfound.header":"NOT FOUND","notfound.description":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness."},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/404/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454","63159454"]}
